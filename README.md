# STG-Ludum-Dare

## Introduction
On Friday April 9, 2016 I teamed up with three good friends of mine to participate in the 
[Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com) competition. *During a Ludum Dare, developers from around the world spend a weekend 
creating games based on a theme suggested by the community.* This was the first time we developed software as team. We 
also opted to write the games engine entirely from the ground up. These two factors lead to us missing the three day
deadline. We possibly could of submitted our prof of concept, however we were not satisfied with it.

Taking part of this event, despite not submitting our work, was a great experience. We learned each of our strengths and
weaknesses as a team. We also agreed to never write a game engine from the ground up, at least with a tight deadline
like that of Ludem Dare's.
